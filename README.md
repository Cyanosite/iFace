# iFace - Facial Attribute Recognition Demo App


## Description
iFace is a demo iOS app that showcases a Facial Attribute Recognition machine learning model. The app enables users to align their face with the camera view, upon which the model analyzes and determines their facial attributes. The process can be halted by double-tapping on the camera view.

## Features
- Capture real-time data from the camera
- Predict various facial attributes using the machine learning model
- Display the predicted attributes

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
    ```bash
    cd iFace
    open iFace.xcodeproj
    ```

3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or your physical device.

## Usage
1. Launch the app on your iOS device.
2. Position your face within the circle.
3. Wait for the app to process the image and predict the facial attributes.
4. View the predicted attributes.
5. Stop predictions with a double-tap on the camera view.
